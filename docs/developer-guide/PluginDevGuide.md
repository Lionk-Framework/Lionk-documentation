## Plugin Development Guide for Lionk

[Full API documentation](https://lionk-framework.github.io/)

### Overview

The Lionk framework allows developers to create custom plugins in the form of **Components** and **Views**. Components represent the core functionality, while Views provide a UI representation for these components. This guide explains how to develop these plugins, the lifecycle of components, and how to create corresponding views.

### Component Development

Components are the fundamental building blocks of a plugin in the Lionk Project. They encapsulate specific functionalities and behaviors and can be cyclic or non-cyclic. Components can inherit from base classes provided by the framework, such as `BaseComponent`, `BaseExecutableComponent`, and `BaseCyclicComponent`.

### Downloads Nuget Packages
To develop a component, you need to install the following NuGet packages:

- [Lionk.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lionk.Core): The core library that provides the base classes and interfaces for developing components and views.
- [Lionk.Core.Razor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lionk.Core.Razor): A library that contains the base classes for developing views for component.

Optionally, you may need additional packages based on the requirements of your component :
- [Lionk.Utils](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lionk.Utils): A library that provides utility classes and extension methods for common tasks such as serialization and more.
- [Lionk.Auth](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lionk.Auth): A library that provides authentication and authorization features for components.
- [Lionk.Auth.Razor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lionk.Auth.Razor): A library that provides base classes for developing authentication and authorization views.

    
#### Component Types

1. **Cyclic Components**: These are components that execute a specific task at a defined interval, repeating until stopped or an error occurs.
2. **Executable Components**: These components perform a specific task upon execution and may not necessarily be cyclic. They can be triggered manually or based on certain conditions.

#### Base Component Classes

To create a new component, you typically inherit from one of the provided base classes:

- **`BaseComponent`**: The most basic form of a component, which includes properties like `Id` and `InstanceName`.
- **`BaseExecutableComponent`**: Extends `BaseComponent` and provides additional methods for executing, aborting, and resetting components. It manages the lifecycle events such as `OnInitialize`, `OnExecute`, and `OnTerminate`.
- **`BaseCyclicComponent`**: Extends `BaseExecutableComponent` to provide support for cyclic execution. It adds properties and methods specific to cyclic execution, such as `Period`, `NbCycle`, and `LastExecution`.

#### Creating a Cyclic Component

To create a cyclic component, you need to inherit from `BaseCyclicComponent`. Below is an example component named `Counter`, which increments a counter value every second:

```csharp
using Lionk.Core;
using Lionk.Core.Component;

namespace Lionk.TestComponent;

/// <summary>
/// Counter test component.
/// </summary>
[NamedElement("Counter test", "test cyclic element")]
public class Counter : BaseCyclicComponent
{
    private int _counter;

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets counter value.
    /// </summary>
    public int CounterValue
    {
        get => _counter;
        set => SetField(ref _counter, value);
    }

    /// <inheritdoc />
    public override bool CanExecute => true;

    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void OnExecute(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        base.OnExecute(ct);
        CounterValue++;
    }

    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void OnInitialize()
    {
        Period = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
        base.OnInitialize();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `CounterValue` is a property that stores the current value of the counter.
- `OnExecute()` increments the counter value each time it is called.
- `OnInitialize()` sets the execution period to 1 second.

#### Component Lifecycle Methods

Components have several lifecycle methods that can be overridden to provide custom behavior:

- **`OnInitialize()`**: Called once before the component is executed. Used to set up initial states or configurations.
- **`OnExecute()`**: Called during each execution cycle. This method contains the core logic of the component.
- **`OnTerminate()`**: Called after the execution logic has completed. Used to clean up or finalize states.

#### Error Handling in Components
If an exception occurs during the execution of a component, the component will automatically enter an error state and the cyclic execution will stop and the component will be aborted.

To handle errors in components, you can use the `Abort()` method to terminate the component's execution and mark it as being in an error state. Hereâ€™s an example component that always throws an error during execution:

```csharp
using Lionk.Core;
using Lionk.Core.Component;

namespace Lionk.TestComponent;

/// <summary>
/// Error test component.
/// </summary>
[NamedElement("Error component", "test cyclic element")]
public class ComponentWhichGoToError : BaseCyclicComponent
{
    /// <inheritdoc />
    public override bool CanExecute => true;

    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void OnExecute(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        base.OnExecute(ct);
        throw new Exception();
    }

    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void OnInitialize()
    {
        Period = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
        base.OnInitialize();
    }
}
```

This component will immediately throw an exception during execution, causing the component to enter an error state.

#### NamedElement Attribute

`NamedElement` is an attribute used to define metadata for a component. It provides a name and a description for the component, which can be used by the framework for identification, logging, and user interface purposes.

The attribute is defined as follows:

```csharp
[NamedElement("Component Name", "Component Description")]
```

For example:

```csharp
[NamedElement("Counter test", "test cyclic element")]
```

This example sets the component's name as "Counter test" and provides a description "test cyclic element."

#### Development Requirements

All components developed for the Lionk Project must meet the following requirements:

- **.NET Version**: Components must be developed with **.NET 8** or higher.
- **Deployment**: Components should be compiled into **.dll (Dynamic Link Library)** files. These .dll files are then loaded as plugins into the Lionk Project application. Make sure to properly reference the required dependencies and libraries when compiling your component into a plugin.

### View Development

Views are used to represent components in a user-friendly way. A view can be a simple display widget, or a more complex configuration panel. There are different types of views based on the context in which they are used.

#### View Types

The Lionk Project framework defines several types of views using the `ViewContext` enum:

1. **Configuration View**: This view is used for configuring a component. It allows users to change settings or parameters related to the component.
   
2. **Detail View**: This view provides detailed information about the component. It is typically used to show additional properties or statuses that are not available in the main view.
   
3. **Page View**: This view is designed to provide a full-page representation of a component or multiple components. It can include detailed information, configuration options, and interactive elements.
   
4. **Widget View**: This is a compact view designed to be displayed in a widget format, often showing a summary or key metric related to the component.

```csharp
public enum ViewContext
{
    Configuration,
    Detail,
    Page,
    Widget
}
```

These view types allow developers to create multiple representations of the same component for different purposes.

#### Creating a Component View

To create a view for a component, you need to inherit from the `ViewBase` class and use the `[ViewOf]` attribute to link it to the corresponding component. Here is an example of a view for the `Counter` component:

```razor
@using System.ComponentModel
@using Lionk.Core.View
@using MudBlazor
@namespace Lionk.TestComponent.CyclicCounter

@attribute [ViewOf("Counter view", typeof(Counter), typeof(CounterView), ViewContext.Widget)]
<MudText Typo="Typo.h4">@Component?.CounterValue</MudText>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public Counter? Component { get; set; }

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        base.OnInitialized();
        if (Component is not null)
            Component.PropertyChanged += ModelChange;
    }

    private void ModelChange(object? sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
        => InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
}
```

This view uses MudBlazor components to display the `CounterValue` property of the `Counter` component. It also subscribes to the `PropertyChanged` event to update the UI when the counter value changes.

#### Creating a Configuration View

A configuration view allows users to interact with and modify the state of a component. Below is an example of a configuration view for the `Counter` component:

```razor
@using Lionk.Core.View
@using MudBlazor
@namespace Lionk.TestComponent.CyclicCounter
@attribute [ViewOf("Counter Configuration", typeof(Counter), typeof(CounterConfig), ViewContext.Configuration)]

<MudButton OnClick="OnResetClick">Reset</MudButton>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public Counter? Component { get; set; }

    private void OnResetClick()
    {
        if (Component is null) return;
        Component.CounterValue = 0;
    }
}
```

This view provides a button to reset the `CounterValue` of the `Counter` component.

### Best Practices

- **Use Proper Naming Conventions**: Ensure your component and view names are descriptive and follow the naming conventions of the framework.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Always use proper error handling in your components to prevent crashes and ensure stability

.
- **Keep Views Simple**: Ensure that views are easy to understand and use. Avoid clutter and focus on the key functionalities.
- **Utilize Base Class Features**: The base classes provide a lot of built-in functionality. Make sure to utilize these features to avoid redundant code.
